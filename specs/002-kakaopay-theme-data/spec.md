- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users visit the Kakaopay tech blog to read technical articles and explore content. They expect a consistent, professional interface that reflects Kakaopay's brand identity with intuitive navigation, readable typography, and a clean design that enhances their reading experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the homepage, **When** they view the interface, **Then** they see Kakaopay's signature yellow (#FFEB00) branding, proper typography (Noto Sans KR), and a dark hero section with white text
2. **Given** a user browses blog posts, **When** they interact with content cards, **Then** they see consistently styled cards with proper spacing (24px base) and hover effects
3. **Given** a user navigates the site, **When** they use the header navigation, **Then** they see a fixed transparent header with "Tech Log" and "Career" menu items and search functionality
4. **Given** a user views content, **When** they read articles, **Then** they experience proper typography hierarchy with H1 (52px, white), H2 (32px, dark), and body text (18px) as specified

### Edge Cases
- What happens when content doesn't have images for cards?
- How does the theme handle extremely long article titles or excerpts?
- How does the dark hero section transition to light content areas?
