## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Korean-speaking user visits the blog site to read technical articles. They can browse articles on the homepage, search for specific content using keywords, and read full articles on dedicated detail pages. The experience should be similar to professional tech blogs like KakaoPay's blog but optimized for Korean content consumption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the homepage, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see a clean list of blog articles with titles, short descriptions, and metadata (date, category) in Korean
2. **Given** a user clicks on an article title, **When** the page loads, **Then** they are taken to a detailed article page showing the full content rendered from markdown
3. **Given** a user wants to find specific content, **When** they use the search function, **Then** they can find relevant articles by typing Korean keywords
4. **Given** a user browses articles, **When** they scroll through the homepage, **Then** articles are organized in a clean, readable format similar to established tech blogs
5. **Given** the site contains sample content, **When** users explore, **Then** they find approximately 50 diverse blog articles covering various topics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when search returns no results?
- How does the system handle very long article titles or content?
- What occurs when a user tries to access a non-existent article page?
- How are articles sorted and paginated if there are many entries?
