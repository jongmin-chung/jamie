## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Next.js, shadcn/ui, TypeScript stack identified
2. Load optional design documents:
   ‚Üí data-model.md: BlogPost, Category, Tag entities
   ‚Üí contracts/: Static API endpoints for posts, search, categories
   ‚Üí research.md: Content processing, search implementation decisions  
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup: Next.js project, shadcn/ui, TypeScript config
   ‚Üí Tests: Component tests, E2E tests, contract validation
   ‚Üí Core: Content processing, search, UI components
   ‚Üí Integration: Page routing, static generation
   ‚Üí Polish: Sample content, performance, deployment
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different components = mark [P] for parallel
   ‚Üí Page dependencies = sequential
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T040)
6. SUCCESS: 40 tasks ready for execution

üìä COMPLETION STATUS: 40/40 tasks completed (100%) ‚úÖ
üéØ ALL TASKS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
‚ú® BONUS: KakaoPay-style UI redesign + 50 Korean blog posts completed
```

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T007) before everything
- Tests (T008-T021) before implementation (T022-T040)  
- T022-T024 (types) before T025-T033 (implementation)
- T025-T029 (core libs) before T030-T033 (components)
- T030-T033 (components) before T034-T037 (pages)
- T037 before T038-T040 (static generation)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Setup Phase (Run T003-T007 together):
```bash
# Terminal 1-5 simultaneously:
pnpx shadcn-ui@latest init && pnpx shadcn-ui@latest add button card input
# Configure Tailwind with Korean fonts
# Setup ESLint/Prettier configs  
# Configure Jest + React Testing Library
# Setup Playwright with Korean locale
```

### Test Phase (Run T008-T015 together):
```bash
# All component and library tests can be written in parallel:
Task: "Contract test markdown parsing in tests/lib/markdown.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test frontmatter parsing in tests/lib/frontmatter.test.ts"
Task: "Component test BlogCard rendering in tests/components/BlogCard.test.tsx"
Task: "Component test SearchBox functionality in tests/components/SearchBox.test.tsx"
Task: "Component test Layout structure in tests/components/Layout.test.tsx"
```

### Core Implementation (Run T022-T024, then T025-T026, T030-T033 together):
```bash
# Types first (parallel):
Task: "BlogPost interface and types in src/types/blog.ts"
Task: "Category and Tag interfaces in src/types/content.ts"  
Task: "Search index types in src/types/search.ts"

# Then core libraries (parallel):
Task: "Markdown parser with remark in src/lib/markdown.ts"
Task: "Frontmatter processor with gray-matter in src/lib/frontmatter.ts"
Task: "Search index builder with flexsearch in src/lib/search-index.ts"

# Then UI components (parallel):
Task: "BlogCard component for post previews in src/components/BlogCard.tsx"
Task: "SearchBox component with Korean input in src/components/SearchBox.tsx"
Task: "Layout component with navigation in src/components/Layout.tsx"
```

## Contract Validation Tasks

### Static API Endpoints (from contracts/blog-api.md)
- T010 validates content metadata matches contract schema
- T012 validates search results match expected format
- T038 validates generated JSON files match API contracts

### Page Routes (from contracts/blog-api.md)  
- T034 implements homepage route per contract
- T035 implements /blog listing with query params
- T036 implements /blog/[slug] individual posts
- T037 handles 404 cases per error contract

## Success Criteria Validation

### From quickstart.md User Scenarios
- T019: Homepage displays Korean posts with metadata ‚úì
- T020: Article pages render markdown content ‚úì  
- T021: Korean search returns relevant results ‚úì
- T021: Mobile responsive design works ‚úì

### Performance Benchmarks
- T038: Page load times <2s for homepage
- T029: Search response <500ms
- T040: Search index <500KB

### Content Requirements
- T039: 50 Korean articles covering tech topics
- T039: Proper frontmatter for all posts
- T039: Categories distributed across predefined types

## Notes
- [P] tasks modify different files and have no dependencies
- All tests must fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Commit after each completed task for atomic changes
- Use shadcn/ui components consistently throughout
- Maintain Korean language support in all text handling
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: All items must be checked before tasks are complete*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding validation tests
- [x] All entities (BlogPost, Category, Tag) have model tasks  
- [x] All tests come before implementation tasks
- [x] Parallel tasks truly modify different files
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD order enforced: failing tests ‚Üí implementation
- [x] Korean language requirements covered
- [x] Performance benchmarks included
